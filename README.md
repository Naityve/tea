# Tea Reviews

I will review teas I try here whenever I remember to.

I will provide as many resources and links to the teas I try if you would be interested in sourcing some for yourself.

I also sweeten my teas with honey.
Links to that will also be below, before the tea reviews.

## _Tea Reviews_

**_Ginseng_**

Strong flavour, mellow aroma. Sweetened with Limoncello infused Honey the flavours remain strong but much tastier in my opinion.

5.5/6

**_Pukka Night Time Berry_**

Strong Aroma of Forest Berries, Sweetened with Limoncello infused honey, honey definitely mellowed out the taste of the berries. Not super strong taste of berries but definitely still there. Aroma very powerful though.

3.5/6

**_Pukka Night Time_**

Strong Lavender Aroma, the chamomile overpowers all the other flavours initially and after a second the lavender after taste emerges. Good before sleep.

4.2 / 6
